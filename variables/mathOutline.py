#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x= "kevin" + " Cuellar"
print(x)

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

y=2+2
print(y)

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x=70-1
print(x)

#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
y=4/4
print(y)

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x=6*5
print(x)

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.

x="kev "*3
print(x)
#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

y=36/6
print(y)

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x=20.5/2.5
print(x)

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

y=5%4
print(y)

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x=2//2
print(x)

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

y=4**4
print(y)

#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error

string="kevin"
print("you are"+string)
print("you are a mf..." + 5)
