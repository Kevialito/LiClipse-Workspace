#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

y= ("kevin" == "nevin")

print(y)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

x= (4==4)
print(x)
#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

y= (4>3)
print(y)
#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

x= (3<10)
print(x)
#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

y= (5>=6)
print(y)
#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

x=(2<=6)
print(x)
#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
